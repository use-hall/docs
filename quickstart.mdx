## Set up channels

To get started with Hall, you'll first need to enable the channels you want to use to provide community support for your customers.

When you first sign up for Hall, the [Support forum](/channels/support-forum) will be enabled by default.

If you already have a [Discord server](/channels/discord) or public [Slack workspace](/channels/slack), you can also connect these channels to bring support questions from these platforms into your [community site](/community-site).

## Explore your community site

The channels you have enabled will be accessible on your [community site](/community-site). The community site is where people can ask questions, search for answers, and create posts and comments.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit your community site">
   To see your community site, simply click the **Your community site** button in the left navigation of the [admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize your community site">
   Theme and style your site with [Customization](/customization) by adding your logo, setting your brand colors, and designing your site's header.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add sources to improve the answer engine">
   Improve [search](/search) and the [answer engine](/answer-engine) by adding sources of external knowledge like documentation, help centers, blog, and other public reference material.
