People can opt in to receive notifications of new comments and replies for any [post](/posts-and-comments).

## Following posts

For every post, someone can click the **Follow** button to receive notifications.

When someone creates a new post, or adds a comment or reply, they will automatically be **Following** the post so that they are notified of new activity.

Clicking the chevron next to the **Follow** button reveals the notification options available:

- **Following**: Receive notifications for new comments and replies.
- **Not following**: Do not receive notifications for new comments and replies unless mentioned.

## Receiving notifications

Notifications are delivered to email and also within the **Notifications inbox** on the [community site](/community-site) when logged-in.

## Managing notifications

People can view all of the posts they are following by:

1. Clicking the **Notifications inbox**,
2. Then clicking the **Settings icon**.

From here, someone can easily **Unfollow** any posts they no longer wish to receive notifications for.

Every email notification also includes a one-click unsubscribe which will automatically unfollow the post that triggered the notification.

## Mentions

Mentioning someone in a post, comment, or reply will also a trigger a notification to that person.

This can be done by typing `@` in the editor, and then by searching for an individual.
