Search is how people ask questions and find answers on your [community site](/community-site). Search works by leveraging our powerful [answer engine](/answer-engine) to surface relevant posts from all your [channels](/channels).

Using our [answer engine](/answer-engine), relevant posts are displayed to people and are ranked by how useful and related the information is to their search query or question.

Search results also display a generative answer that is powered by our [answer engine](/answer-engine) and any [sources](/sources) you have added.

Relevant and related [sources](/sources) are also displayed as references for the generative answer that is produced by our [answer engine](/answer-engine). These sources can be opened as external links from the search results page.

From the search results, someone can click to open any post in a modal to read, learn more about discussions related to their question, and respond to the [helpfulness survey](/helpfulness-survey).
