Service Plans are offered in packages based, in part, on the number of Authorized Users and other features and capabilities. Customer may add Authorized Users to their Service Plan by accessing the billing management settings for Customer’s account via the Services. Subscription fees for Service Plans are based on annual or monthly periods that begin on the Order start date and each annual or monthly anniversary of the start date.

Depending on the Service Plan selected by Customer, Customer may lose access to certain features and functionality offered in the Free Services. If Customer does not subscribe to a Service Plan upon expiration of any time limited Free Services, then Customer will cease access to the Services and Company reserves the right to delete Customer’s Free Services account (and any Customer Data contained therein) in its sole discretion, without notice or any further liability or obligation.

If Customer wishes to reduce the number of Authorized Users or the applicable Service Plan, it must do so before the start of the next Renewal Order Term. Company reserves the right to increase fees for a Renewal Order Term and Customer shall pay such increased fees unless it has opted out in accordance with Section 3.4 below. Customer expressly authorizes Company to charge applicable fees for Customer’s Service Plan on a recurring basis, in accordance with Section 4.

### 3.4. Cancellation

Either Party may opt-out of Order renewal for a Service Plan by providing the other Party written notice of its intention not to renew an Order for a Service Plan at least 30 days prior to the Order’s then current expiration date.

## 6. Confidentiality

### 6.1. Definition

**“Confidential Information”** means all confidential information disclosed by a party (**“Disclosing Party”**) to the other party (**“Receiving Party”**), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure, including all copies thereof. Confidential Information of Customer includes Customer Data, Confidential Information of Company includes the Service (including its software and content, other than Customer Data) and the work product created from its performance of any Professional Services, and Confidential Information of each Party includes the terms of this Agreement. However, Confidential Information will not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally available to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (c) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reliance on the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.

### 6.2. Protection

The Receiving Party will: (a) use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but in no event less than reasonable care); (b) not use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement; and (c) except as otherwise authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of the Receiving Party’s and its Affiliates’ employees, contractors, and agents who need such access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who are subject to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those herein. The Receiving Party will provide prompt written notice to the Disclosing Party of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Customer acknowledges and agrees that consumer laws do not apply. If however any Applicable Laws (such as Australian Consumer Law (**“ACL”**) in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth)), do apply and cannot otherwise be lawfully excluded, nothing in this Agreement will restrict, exclude or modify any statutory warranties, guarantees, rights or remedies Customer has.

### 7.5. Disclaimer

### 11.7. Disputes

Each Party agrees to use its best endeavors to use mediation and negotiation to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, prior to resorting to an external dispute resolution process before commencing any lawsuit or court proceeding.

### 11.9. Relationship of the Parties; Third Party Beneficiaries

The Parties are independent contractors and this Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship between the Parties. There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.

### 11.10. Miscellaneous

No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right under this Agreement will constitute a waiver of that right. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. This Agreement, including all exhibits hereto and all Orders, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, or representations, written or oral, concerning Customer’s purchase and use of the Service and any Professional Services. No modification, amendment, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by each of the Parties. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and any exhibit hereto or any Order, the terms of such exhibit or Order will prevail. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, no terms or conditions stated in any Customer purchase order or other Customer ordering documentation (excluding Orders) will be incorporated into or form any part of this Agreement, and all such terms or conditions will be null and void. As used herein, the words “include” and “including” shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”

### 11.11. Counterparts

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall constitute a duplicate original, but all counterparts together shall constitute a single agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to an Order by email of a scanned copy, or execution and delivery through an electronic signature service (such as DocuSign), shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of the relevant Order.

### 11.12. Changes to this Agreement

Company may modify this Agreement at any time by posting a revised version at https://usehall.com/legal/, which modifications will become effective as of the date they are posted; provided however, (a) if an Order specifies a monthly subscription, the modifications will take effect the first day of the next monthly renewal term following the month in which they were first posted; and (b) if an Order specifies a fixed term of 12 months or longer, the modifications will instead be effective immediately upon the start of the next Renewal Order Term. In either case, if Customer objects to the updated Agreement, as its sole and exclusive remedy, Customer may choose not to renew, including canceling any terms set to become in force at renewal. For the avoidance of doubt, any Order is subject to the version of the Agreement in effect at the time of the Order.
