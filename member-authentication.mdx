Signing up to your [community site](/community-site) enables people make contributions. 

People log in to through your community site using their email address. When logging in, a unique 6-digit code will be sent to verify their email.

To minimize the friction of signing up, people are not required to complete profile information like setting a name or profile photo.

People are only required to complete profile information before making contributions, such as [posts and comments](/posts-and-comments).

People that sign up are shown as [members](/members) in the [admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com).
