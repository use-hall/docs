title: "Helpfulness survey"
description: "How we qualitatively measure if an answer or post was helpful"
---

The helpfulness survey is displayed in various places across your [community site](/community-site), such as in [search](/search).

We use this information to qualitatively assess if a post or result produced by our [answer engine](/answer-engine) was helpful in answering someone's question.

The survey simplify asks **Did this answer your question?**, to which someone can respond with:

|     | Description                  |
| --- | ---------------------------- |
| 😞  | Unhelpful                    |
| 😐  | Neither helpful or unhelpful |
| 😃  | Helpful                      |

It is on our roadmap to make the results of the helpfulness survey available in the [reports](/reports) within the [admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com).
