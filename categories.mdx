description: Learn how to create and manage categories on your community site
---

Categories group and organize similarly themed posts on your [community site](/community-site).

Categories, once created, will appear in the sidebar of the homepage of your community site. These categories can be used to filter posts on your community site.

## Defining categories

Categories can be created and managed from the [admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com).

## Posts and categories

New posts created on your community site will be automatically labelled into your defined categories based on their title and content.

Categories can be manually added and removed from individual posts by an admin.
