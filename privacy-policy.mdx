This Privacy Policy applies to the collection, use, disclosure and handling of Personal Information by Hall Technologies Pty. Ltd. ACN 669 790 738 (**“we”**, **“us”**, or **“our”**) and our Affiliates, including information collected via usehall.com (our **“website”**), our Services, and through your communication and interactions with us.
Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given to those terms in our Cloud Subscription Agreement.

Your privacy is very important to us, and we encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully. By providing Personal Information to us, you consent to our collection, handling, use and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we are not able to collect certain Personal Information about you, this may limit your ability to use or access the Services.

This Policy does not apply to websites, apps, products, or services that we do not own or control. Further, where our Services are made available to you via an organization (for example, where your employer is our Customer and has made you an Authorized User of the Services under our contract with them), that organization will control the information processed via the Services, including Customer Data. This means that this Privacy Policy will not apply to that information, and we will not be responsible for the privacy practices of that organization. Rather, your information will be subject to that organization’s practices, policies, and collection notices. We encourage you to review these materials as they relate to the handling of your information.
