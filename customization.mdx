The look and feel of your community site can be customized from the [admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com).

## Customization options

The following options are available to theme and customize to match your brand.

### Buttons

- **Button background:** Button background color is set for both light and dark modes. Note that the button text color will be automatically calculated to ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility.

- **Button style:** Changes the display of the corner radius of the button.

### Header

The header appears at the top of your community site.

- **Welcome message:** The headline text displayed above the search input.
- **Header logo:** A logo for your company displayed in the header. We recommend uploading an SVG file, but other image formats are accepted.
- **Text color:** The color of any text in the header. We recommend choosing an appropriate color that works for your selected background and considers accessibility.
- **Background:** A **color**, **image**, or **gradient** can be set as the header background. If using an image, we recommend ensuring that any text and interface elements that appear above the background are accessible and clearly visible.

### Icons

Icons will be used in various places on your community site.

- **Logo icon:** This should be a smaller version of your logo displayed in a square or a 1:1 aspect ratio. This will be used in email notifications and shown to members when signing up and logging in.
- **Favicon:** This icon is displayed in the browser tab at 16Ã—16 pixels.
