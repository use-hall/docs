The community site is where your [members](/members) sign up and participate in your community.

Your community site is accessible on its own unique `.hall.community` subdomain, or on a [custom domain](/custom-domains) if configured.

## Member sign up and log in

Members sign up and log in to through your community site using their email address.

When logging in, a unique 6-digit code will be sent to verify their email. Once verified, they will appear as a member in your [admin dashboard](/members).
