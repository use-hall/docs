The members page lets you see information about all the people who have signed up to your [community site](/community-site) or made contributions from any of your [connected channels](/channels).

For each member, you can see:

- **Name**: this is set in a member's profile from your [community site](/community-site). If a member is synced from [Slack](/channels/slack) or [Discord](/channels/discord) this will show their display name from the respective channel.
- **Email:** this is the email used to sign up to your [community site](/community-site), or the email address attached to their Slack profile if using the [Slack channel](/channels/slack). Emails are not available for the [Discord channel](/channels/discord) as this information is not made available. All email addresses are verified.
- **Company:** we use third-party data providers to automatically identify the company that member belongs to using the domain of their email address. If a company cannot be determined from their email address, the company will be displayed as _Unknown_.
- **Joined:** the date that they became a member or made their first contribution.
- **Last seen:** the date when they were last seen logged in to your [community site](/community-site), or when their last contribution was made.

## Recent activity and contributions

Activity and contributions by members can be viewed by clicking each member.

For each member you can see their activity in the **Recent activity** tab:
- **Pages viewed:** the pages each member has viewed while logged into your [community site](/community-site)
- **Comments made:** the comments or replies a member has added.
- **Reactions:** reactions they have added to posts, comments, or replies.

You can also see the posts created by a member in the **Contributions** tab.

## Unknown members

Unknown members are those who have signed up and verified their email, but have not yet completed their profile information.

When signing up, members are not required to complete profile information like setting a name or profile photo. This reduces friction of new members signing up and improves their overall user experience.

Instead, members are required to complete profile information before making contributions.

Unknown members are still displayed in the member count for your community.

## Deactivating members

Should you wish to remove or "ban" a member from your community, you can deactivate any member at any time.

Deactivating a member will hide their profile on content they’ve contributed without removing any of their contributions.

While deactivated, they won’t be able to log in or sign up again to your [community site](/community-site) using their email. Their profile photo will be removed and their name will be displayed as _Deactivated member_ to other members.

To deactivate a member:

Find the member you want to deactivate on the Members page.
1. Click the **•••** icon, and select **Deactivate**.
2. Confirm this action by clicking **Deactivate member**.
3. Members can be reactivated at any time by following the same steps.
