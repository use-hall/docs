You can optionally provide an [invite link](https://slack.com/intl/en-au/help/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-workspace#share-an-invitation-link) for people to join your public Slack workspace. You can create an invite link for your Slack workspace by following the steps in [Slack's documentation](https://slack.com/intl/en-au/help/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-workspace#share-an-invitation-link).

Once created you can set your Slack invite link in Hall by navigating to [**Channels** in the admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com/channels), then select:
1. **Manage** for Slack.
2. Go to the **Slack invite link** section.

When set, this link will be displayed in various contexts within Hall to encourage and promote people to join the conversation from within the Slack client.
