When new messages are posted in the channels you are [syncing](./syncing), you can enable an automated reply.

This automated reply includes a link to relevant answers that we have found in your [community site](/community-site) using our [answer engine](/answer-engine).

This helps people to find answers to their questions while they wait for someone to reply.

This automated reply will come from a bot/app user in your Slack workspace.

If your organization logo and name has been configured, the bot name will appear with these customizations instead of as "Hall".
