To sync channels from Slack, navigate to [**Channels** in the admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com/channels), then select:
1. **Manage** for Slack.
2. Go to the **Synced Slack channels** section.
3. Click **Add a channel**.
4. Select the Slack channels you wish to sync.

## Sync behavior

Hall will not sync a message sent in a channel unless it has been created into a **thread**. This ensures that all relevant replies made in a thread can be synced as replies in Hall.

- The **thread title**, **post content**, and any **attachments** are synced with Hall.
- **Reactions** are currently not synced.
- Deleted messages in Slack are automatically deleted in Hall.

## Automatic message syncing

You can choose to enable or disable automatic syncing of messages with Hall. By default, all Slack threads will be synced with Hall.

To change this setting, navigate to [**Channels** in the admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com/channels), then select:
1. **Manage** for Slack.
2. Go to the **Automatic message syncing** section.

If you disable syncing, messages will have to be manually pushed to Hall.

[Slack workspace admins](https://slack.com/intl/en-au/help/articles/360018112273-Types-of-roles-in-Slack) are able to manually push messages to Hall by:
1. Clicking the action button **•••** for the message you wish to push.
2. Selecting the **More message shortcuts…** menu.
3. Choosing the **Push to community site** action from the Hall Slack app.
