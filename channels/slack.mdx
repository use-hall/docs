The Slack integration syncs support questions created by Slack users into your [community site](/community-site) and into the [answer engine](/answer-engine) to build a knowledgebase that your customers use to self-serve answers to questions.

The community site is also fully [optimized for search engines](/search-engine-optimization), allowing customers to discover support conversations from Slack in search results.
