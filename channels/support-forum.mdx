## Disabling Support forum

If you only want your [community site](/community-site) to show support questions from [Discord](/channels/discord) or [Slack](/channels/slack), you may decide to disable the Support forum channel.

Disabling the support forum channel will prevent [new posts](/posts-and-comments) from being created by people.

To disable the Support forum:
1. Navigate to **Channels** in the [admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com).
2. Then click **Manage** for **Support forum**.
3. Then click **Disable**.

The Support forum can be enabled again at any time.
