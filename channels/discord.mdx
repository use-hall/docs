The Discord integration syncs support questions created by Discord users into your [community site](/community-site) and into the [answer engine](/answer-engine) to build a knowledgebase that your customers use to self-serve answers to questions.

The community site is also fully [optimized for search engines](/search-engine-optimization), allowing customers to discover support conversations from Discord in search results.

## Quickstart

Set up the Discord channel integration in just three simple steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable the Discord channel in Hall">
    Navigate to [**Channels** in the admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com/channels), and then click **Set up** for Discord.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Hall Discord app in your server">
   This will add the Hall bot to your server and enable us to add commands to sync Discord with Hall.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the Discord channels to sync with Hall">
    [Select the channels](/channels/discord/syncing) that will be synced with Hall.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Syncing Discord channels

The Discord channel integration in Hall works by syncing conversation threads from specific Discord channels into your Hall community site. Hall supports syncing from [Forum channels](/channels/discord/syncing#discord-forum-channels) and [Text channels](/channels/discord/syncing#discord-text-channels).

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Forum channels" href="/channels/discord/syncing#discord-forum-channels">
    Sync posts that have been created in a forum channel.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Text channels" href="/channels/discord/syncing#discord-text-channels">
    Sync any Discord text messages that have been created into threads.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Importing all Discord messages

By default, Hall will only sync messages from Discord that have been sent after the Hall app is installed on your Discord server.

You can manually sync messages created before this by navigating to [**Channels** in the admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com/channels), then select:
1. **Manage** for Discord.
2. Go to the **Import all Discord messages** section.
3. Click **Import all Discord messages**.

This action is a bulk operation that will be performed in the background and may take several minutes to be completed. Very old archived posts that cannot be accessed via Discord's API will not be imported.
