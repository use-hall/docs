Posts are created by people, either directly through your [community site](/community-site) if using the [Support forum](/channels/support-forum) channel, or by syncing posts (and their replies) that were created in [Discord](/channels/discord) or [Slack](/channels/slack).

## Comments and replies

People can contribute to the discussion of a post by adding comments or replies.

## Post status

The status of a post is used to quickly communicate to people if a post is relevant and if a solution has been found.

Posts can have the following statuses:

- **Unanswered:** no comments or replies have been added to a post, yet.
- **Active:** a post has had a comment or reply in the last 30 days.
- **Inactive:** a post has not been active for more than 30 days.
- **Solved:** a post has been marked as solved by someone.
