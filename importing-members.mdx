We can manually assist customers looking to import members from other community or marketing platforms.

To import members manually, you will need to provide us with a CSV file that includes:

- The **email address** for the member.
- The **full name** for the member, optional but highly encouraged.

Any email address should be verified, and you must have received the content of the member to opt-in to your community.

As members log in to your community using a passwordless link sent to their email address, no password or other account data is required to import members.

Please contact us to discuss a manual import of members.

## Supported platforms

A non-exhaustive list of platforms that support exporting member data in the format we require, include:

- Slack
- Mailchimp
- Discourse
- HubSpot
- Salesforce
- SendGrid
- Shopify
- Klaviyo

If you are unsure how to export member data from a platform you are using, please contact us and we will help.
