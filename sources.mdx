Sources are the knowledge used to help customers self-serve and find relevant answers to their questions in features like [search](/search) and our [answer engine](/answer-engine).

Sources currently need to be manually approved and added by us. To add sources, please contact us by clicking the **Help icon** in the admin dashboard.

### Custom sources

Any publicly accessible website can be added as a source. For example, you might want to add your product's marketing website or blog as a source to surface this knowledge in Hall.

### Third-party sources

In addition to your website, Hall also integrates with popular sources of knowledge, such as help centers, official documentation, or community contributions published elsewhere.
