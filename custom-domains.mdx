Custom domains enable you to have your [community site](/community-site) display on your own domain name or subdomain, like `community.example.com`.

To configure a custom domain for your site, you will need access to modify the DNS records for your domain name.

## Configure custom domain

1. Contact us with your desired custom domain (eg. `community.example.com`).
2. We will provision your custom domain within 24 hours.
3. You will be provided with `CNAME` records to add to your DNS server.
4. Once these records have been added by you, we will finalize the set up.

The [canonical URLs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/canonicalization) for your site will automatically be updated to your new custom domain to ensure [search any optimization](/search-engine-optimization) is not negatively affected by this change.
